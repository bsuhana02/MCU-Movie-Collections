**Description**
This dataset contains the box office collections of Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films across various countries from 2012 to 2019. The figures represent total earnings in millions of dollars, showcasing the financial performance of MCU movies in key international markets.

**Data Structure**

**Columns:**
Location: The country or region where the box office collections were recorded.
2012 - 2019: Annual box office collections for each year, measured in millions.
Rows: Each row corresponds to a specific country, providing its box office collections for each year from 2012 through 2019.

**Task requirements:**
Calculate the Total Box Office Collections for Each Location
Calculate the total box office collections for each location (country) from 2012 to 2019.

Calculate the Total Box Office Collections for Each Year
Compute the total box office collections across all locations for each year from 2012 to 2019.

Calculate the Average Box Office Collections Per Year
Determine the average box office collections for all locations per year over the specified period.

Count the Total Number of Locations Included in the Analysis
Create a function to count the total number of locations (countries) included in the dataset.

Create a Line Chart for a Specific Location
Create a line chart to illustrate the trend of box office collections for Marvel movies in the USA over the years (2012-2019).

Create a Column Chart for Comparative Analysis
Develop a column chart to compare the total box office collections of all locations for the year 2019. Additionally, create a pie chart to represent the percentage distribution of total collections recorded by each location over the entire period (2012-2019).

Rename Sheets
Change the name of Sheet1 to "Box Office Data," Sheet2 to "Annual Totals," and Sheet3 to "Insights." After that, copy the table headers (locations and years) from the "Box Office Data" worksheet and paste them into the "Annual Totals" worksheet.

Calculate Yearly Percentages
In the "Annual Totals" worksheet, compute the percentage of box office collections for each location per year in relation to the total box office collections for that year, using a single formula that can be applied to all relevant cells.
Implement a Rating System
Copy the table headers from the "Box Office Data" worksheet to the "Insights" worksheet. In the "Insights" worksheet, implement a function that outputs "Above Average" if the box office collections for a location in a given year are greater than the yearly average, and "Below Average" if they are not. This calculation should be done using a single formula that can be replicated across all applicable cells.
Identify Trends in Box Office Collections
Identify and highlight any trends or significant changes in box office collections for specific locations between 2018 and 2019. Provide commentary on possible implications of these trends based on the data.
